# Reproducibility Challenge
## Reconciling modern machine learning practice and thte bias-variance trade-off

In this repository we gather the code used for the reproducibility challenge based on the paper:

"Reconciling modern machine learning practice and the bias-variance trade-off"

by Mikhail Belkin, Daniel Hsu, Siyuan Ma, and Soumik Mandal.

The repo contains 3 folders which are structured as follows:


**bin**: contains non-source code files related to the project, e.g. the paper in pdf format.

**code**: containts all the code used for our reproducibility challenge.

**report**: contains the TeX files used to produce the final report.
